        </ul>

        <h3>Challenges faced:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>This is my first real project.  As such, I’m still just learning how web design works.  It’s exciting!  But I hope I’m doing a decent job.</li>
            <li>I’m working remotely:  I’m in the U.S. while everyone I’m working with is in Peru.  Fortunately, we are in the same time zone.  On the upside, my written communication skills are constantly improving.</li>
            <li>I haven’t been able to figure out how to upload JavaScript files to their server, so all scripts are written inside the HTML.</li>
            <li>It is uncertain whether the CTTC will have the help of another programmer when they want to revise this site.  Thus, I need to make sure everything is as user-friendly as possible.</li>
        </ul>
